PRIORITY:
terse operations- OPERATE SET R = 1, G = 2, B = 5
bigger intermediary representation of pixels
parse float
consider #DEADBE as #DEADBEFF (6 byte as bitshift to 8 || FF)
IN1, IN2, ..., BUFF1, BUFF2, etc...

refactor to parse into non-string tokens, then make sense of them; rather than "try to read a 'value' NOW"
sin functions, but immediately gets clamped. hold value as float til last minute?
clamp operations? (R-12) for R = 11? 255? 0?
corrupts when -i == -o
add asserts in query parsing
bitmap indexed, compressed format support
png/jpg/etc... support
